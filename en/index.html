          Hannover<br />Deutschland<br /><br />GeschÃ¤ftsfÃ¼hrer: Tobias Jankowiak<br /><br />Handelsregisternummer: HRB
          215250<br /><br />USt-IDNr.: DE 311934471<br /><br />Telefonnummer: +49 171 1864050<br /><br />E-Mail-Adresse:

        <p id="agb-txt">Terms & Conditions<br /><br />
          The following GTCs also contain legal information on your rights under the regulations on distance
          contracts and electronic commerce for end customers<br /><br />
          1. Scope of application<br />
          The following terms and conditions apply to all services rendered and are therefore legally binding
          for all customer traffic of Solarranch. Conflicting or deviating terms and conditions of the customer
          are not recognised. Deviating agreements, conditions or supplements, telephone and verbal
          agreements are only binding if they are confirmed in writing by Solarranch. Conflicting terms and
          conditions of the customer are contradicted.<br /><br />
          2. Conclusion of contract in the online shop<br />
          All Solarranch offers in the online shop are subject to change and non-binding and do not yet
          represent the offer to conclude a contract. By clicking on the button "order subject to payment" the
          customer makes a binding offer to purchase the goods in the shopping cart. The order confirmation
          sent automatically after the order is sent confirms the content and receipt of the customer's order at
          Solarranch, but does not yet represent acceptance of the customer's offer. A contract is only
          concluded when Solarranch has declared acceptance, which is sent by a separate e-mail (order
          confirmation or confirmation of dispatch), but no later than when the order is dispatched.
          Solarranch will declare acceptance either by sending a shipping confirmation or by shipping the
          goods within five working days of receipt of the customer's order. If Solarranch does not issue an
          acceptance declaration within this period, the customer's order has not been accepted.<br /><br />
          3. Prices and terms of payment<br />
          All prices are final prices which include the statutory value added tax and other price components. If
          additional shipping and packaging costs are incurred, their amount is expressly stated. The ordered
          goods are to be paid for in advance by bank transfer. A delivery on account is only made in
          exceptional cases and in the case of a permanent business relationship. The invoice amount is due
          for payment immediately without deduction. The customer is only entitled to offset against
          counterclaims or to assert rights of retention if the counterclaims are undisputed, legally established
          or recognised by Solarranch. The goods remain the property of Solarranch until full payment has
          been made.<br /><br />
          4. Delivery / Delivery Date, Delivery period<br />
          Delivery is made at the expense of the purchaser and at the risk of the Solarranch company. The
          delivery obligations of Solarranch are fulfilled as soon as the goods have been handed over to the
          buyer. The risk is transferred to the buyer upon receipt of the goods. If free delivery has been
          agreed, the buyer must take delivery of the goods before the delivery address at the place which can
          reasonably be reached by vehicle. The Solar Ranch reserves the right to choose the route and means
          of transport. Delays in delivery and performance due to force majeure and due to events that make
          delivery difficult or impossible (these include in particular strikes, lock-outs, official orders, delays by
  
          our suppliers, sovereign measures, etc., even if they occur at suppliers of Solarranch or their sub-
          suppliers) entitle us to postpone the delivery or performance for the duration of the hindrance plus
  
          a reasonable start-up time. Furthermore, the customer is obliged to inform us immediately or as
          soon as possible of any damage. The delivery will be made immediately after receipt of payment or
          after placing the order. Partial deliveries are permissible. This does not result in any additional costs
          for the customer. Information about delivery times is not binding, unless the delivery date has
          exceptionally been bindingly promised by Solarranch.<br /><br />
          5. Right of withdrawal, return shipment<br />
          If the customer is a consumer, he is entitled to a right of revocation according to Â§Â§ 312d, 355 BGB
          (German Civil Code) in the case of a distance selling contract. The revocation instruction is shown
          separately on our website.<br /><br />
  
          6. Notices of defects / liability for defects and warranty<br />
          Information, drawings, illustrations, technical data, weight, dimensional and performance
          descriptions which are on the Solarranch website are for information purposes only. Solarranch
          accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of this information. With regard to the type and scope of
          delivery, only the information contained in the dispatch confirmation is authoritative. The customer
          is obliged - if he is a merchant - to report all recognisable defects, shortfalls or incorrect deliveries
          immediately after receipt of the goods, but before processing or installation, by telephone as well as
          in writing by post, fax or in text form by e-mail. If there is a defect that is subject to warranty, the
          customer is entitled within the framework of the statutory provisions to demand subsequent
          performance, to withdraw from the contract or to reduce the purchase price.<br /><br />
          7. Reservation of title<br />
          All delivered goods remain the property of Solarranch until all claims we have against you now or in
          the future on any legal grounds have been satisfied. This also applies in the event that the goods
          have already been fully or partially processed. An acquisition of ownership according to Â§ 950 of the
          German Civil Code is excluded. The purchaser is only entitled to resell the goods subject to retention
          of title within the framework of normal business transactions and on the condition that he assigns to
          Solarranch all claims against his customer arising from the resale of the unprocessed goods. Pledging
          and transfer by way of security of the reserved goods are not permitted. In the event of a pledge or
          other impairment of the reserved property, the purchaser is obliged to notify Solarranch
          immediately. If the customer is in default of payment, we are entitled to demand the return of the
          goods delivered under retention of title and extended retention of title as security. This demand as
          well as the enforcement of the delivered goods by us shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal from
          the contract, likewise not the demand to store and mark the goods subject to retention of title
          separately. At our request, the customer is obliged to inform us, by submitting copies of invoices, of
          the names of his customers against whom he has acquired claims through the sale of our goods and
          the amounts owed by them.<br /><br />
          8. Data protection<br />
          The personal data provided by the customer will be processed in accordance with the provisions of
          German data protection law. Personal data, insofar as these are necessary for the establishment,
          content or modification of the contractual relationship (inventory data), are used exclusively for the
          processing of the contracts concluded between Solarranch and the customer. Any other use of
          inventory data beyond this will not be made without express consent. The personal data required to
          enable and invoice the use of Solarranch's offers (usage data) are also used exclusively to process
          the contracts concluded.<br /><br />
          9. Place of performance and jurisdiction<br />
          The place of performance is the headquarters of the Solar Ranch. If the customer is a merchant, a
          legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, our registered office is the exclusive
          place of jurisdiction if no other exclusive place of jurisdiction exists by law.<br /><br />
          10. Final provisions<br />
          Amendments or supplements to these GTC must be made in writing. Should individual provisions of
          these GTC be ineffective or contradict statutory provisions, the effectiveness of the remaining
          provisions shall not be affected thereby.<br /><br />

        <p id="wrb-txt">Cancellation policy<br /><br />
          Right of withdrawal<br />
          You may revoke your contractual declaration within 14 days without stating reasons by means of a
          clear declaration. The period begins after receipt of this instruction on a permanent data carrier. The
          timely dispatch of the revocation suffices to comply with the revocation period if the declaration is
          made on a durable data carrier (e.g. letter, fax, e-mail).<br />
          The revocation is to be addressed to:<br />
          C2EX GmbH -Kopernikusstr.14 -30167 Hannover<br /><br />
          Consequences of withdrawal<br />
          IIn the event of an effective cancellation, the services received by both parties are to be returned.
          You are obliged to pay compensation for the value of the service provided up to the time of
          revocation if you were informed of this legal consequence before submitting your contractual
          declaration and have expressly agreed that we shall begin to perform the service in return before
          the end of the revocation period. If there is an obligation to pay compensation for lost value, this
          may mean that you will still have to fulfil your contractual payment obligations for the period until
          revocation. Your right of revocation expires prematurely if the contract is completely fulfilled by
          both parties at your express request before you have exercised your right of revocation. Obligations
          to refund payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. For you, the period begins with the dispatch of
          your declaration of revocation, for us with its receipt.<br /><br />
  
          Sample revocation form<br />
          If you want to cancel the contract, please fill in this form and send it back to<br /><br />
          C2EX GmbH<br />
          Kopernikusstr. 14<br />
          30167 Hannover<br />
          E-Mail: info@solarranch.de<br /><br />
          I/we (*) hereby revoke the contract concluded by me/us (*) for the purchase of the following goods

          Revocation or return policy<br />
  
          You can cancel your contract declaration within 14 days without giving reasons in writing (e.g. letter,
          fax, e-mail) or - if the goods have been delivered to you before the end of this period - by returning
          the goods. The time limit begins after receipt of this notification in writing, but not before receipt of
          the goods by the recipient (in the case of recurring deliveries of similar goods not before receipt of
          the first partial delivery) and also not before we have fulfilled our duty to supply information in
          accordance with Article 246 Â§ 2 in conjunction with Â§ 1 para 1 and 2 EGBGB as well as our obligations
          under Â§ 312e para 1 sentence 1 BGB in conjunction with Article 246 Â§ 3 EGBGB. The timely dispatch
          of the revocation or the goods is sufficient to comply with the revocation period. The revocation is to
          be addressed to:<br /><br />
  
          Tobias Jankowiak, C2EX GmbH, Kopernikusstr.14, 30167 Hannover- info@solarranch.de<br /><br />
  
          Sales tax identification number according to Â§ 27<br /><br />
          Value Added Tax Act:<br />
  
          Consequences of cancellation In the event of an effective cancellation, the services received by both
          parties are to be returned and any benefits derived (e.g. interest) surrendered. If you are unable to
          return the received goods or services in whole or in part or only in a deteriorated condition, you may
          have to pay compensation for lost value. This does not apply to the surrender of goods if the
          deterioration of the goods is exclusively attributable to their inspection - as would have been
          possible for you in a shop, for example. In addition, you can avoid the obligation to pay
          compensation for any deterioration of the goods caused by the intended use of the goods by not
          using the goods as if they were your property and by refraining from doing anything that could
          impair their value. Goods that can be sent as a parcel are to be returned at our risk. You have to bear
          the costs of the return shipment if the delivered goods correspond to the ordered goods and if the
          price of the goods to be returned does not exceed an amount of 40 euros or if, in the case of a
          higher price of the goods, you have not yet provided the consideration or a contractually agreed
          partial payment at the time of the revocation. Otherwise the return shipment is free of charge for
          you. Goods that cannot be sent by parcel post will be collected from you. Obligations to refund
          payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. The period begins for you with the dispatch of your
          declaration of revocation or the goods, for us with their receipt.</p>
